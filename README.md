# Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension

The Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension is a customizable dashboard that enhances your browsing experience by providing useful information and functionality right at your fingertips. Built with HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and ASYNC JS, this extension utilizes multiple APIs, including CoinGecko, OpenWeather, and Unsplash, to fetch data and provide features such as background images, Dogecoin currency data, weather information, and a clock with the current time and date.

## Features

1. **Random Background Images**: The Personal Dashboard displays a random background image sourced from the Unsplash API each time you open a new tab. Each image is accompanied by the name of the photographer who captured it, adding a touch of inspiration and beauty to your browsing experience.

2. **Dogecoin Currency Data**: Stay updated on the latest Dogecoin cryptocurrency information. The extension utilizes the CoinGecko API to fetch the current price, market cap, and percentage change of Dogecoin. This feature is especially useful for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors.

3. **Weather Information**: The Personal Dashboard collects your coordinates using the browser's geolocation API and fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API. It displays the current weather conditions in your area, including temperature, humidity, and a brief description of the weather. You can quickly glance at the dashboard to plan your day accordingly.

4. **Current Time and Date**: The dashboard prominently features a clock displaying the current time and date. This ensures you can keep track of time while browsing and stay organized throughout the day.

5. **Room for Improvement**: The extension has the potential for further enhancement. Here are some suggested features that could be implemented:

   - **Display Selected Crypto Currency**: Allow users to choose and display data for their preferred cryptocurrency alongside Dogecoin.
   - **To-Do List**: Incorporate a to-do list feature, enabling users to manage tasks and increase productivity within the dashboard.
   - **Background Image Categories**: Provide an option for users to select specific categories of background images, such as animals or nature, catering to individual preferences.
